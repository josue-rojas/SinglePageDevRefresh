# SinglePageDev
A node server for quick single page development using.

## Purpose
So I usually when I am practicing web development, more specifically design, I like to do quick one page sites. When making these one pages I think the biggest waste of time is switching to a browser and refreshing the page to see the changes. This is were this server comes in. It is meant to refresh a page when there is a change.

I tried a while back to do something without modifying the index.html but I find it a bit tedious to always have the tab at the right place (focus). You can check it [here](https://github.com/josuerojasrojas/BrowserRefresh).
